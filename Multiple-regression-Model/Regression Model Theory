The multiple linear regression is used to explain the relationship between one continuous dependent variable and two or more independent variables. 
The independent variables can be continuous or categorical.

Simple linear regression is used to find the best fit line of a dataset. If the data isn't continuous, there really isn't going to be a best fit line
